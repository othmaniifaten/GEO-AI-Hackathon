Problem Statement
Introduction
Welcome to the Tunisia GeoAI Hack 2022 Crop Type Mapping Challenge! This private hackathon is exclusively open to Tunisia GeoAI Hack 2022 participants, which includes University Students and Young Professionals who are passionate about leveraging technology to address pressing global challenges.

The Challenge
With the world's population steadily growing, there is an increasing need for innovative solutions to sustainably boost agricultural production, optimize the global supply chain, reduce food waste, and ensure access to nutritious food, particularly in developing countries and Africa. This challenge aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) to "End hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."

Problem Statement: Crop type mapping is a critical task for agricultural and environmental policymakers. The proliferation of open Satellite imagery time series has provided a unique opportunity for large-scale crop mapping. The primary objective of this challenge is to harness Sentinel-2 multispectral time series data to classify crops in Central Tunisia, specifically in the Kairouan agricultural region.

Data Sources
The ground truth reference data for this challenge was meticulously collected in the field by the AGEOS Team. The challenge datasets have been meticulously processed by dedicated members of the IEEE Sup'com GRSS Chapter.

Prizes and Open Source Contribution
This competition is made possible through the generous support of InstaDeep and Sup'Com University. We encourage participants to take this opportunity to make a meaningful impact. To be eligible for cash prizes, winners must be from Tunisia and commit to releasing their top solutions under an open-source license. This approach ensures ongoing use and learning from the solutions developed during the challenge
